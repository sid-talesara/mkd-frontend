        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What is a mobile phone?</h2>
        <p className="text-base mb-4">
          A mobile phone, also known as a cell phone or cellular telephone, is a small portable device that allows users
          to make and receive calls over a radio frequency link while they are moving within a telephone service area.
          Unlike fixed-location phones (landline phones), mobile phones are wireless and can be used to communicate over
          long distances without wires. Over time, mobile phones have evolved to do much more than just voice calls—they
          now accommodate web browsers, games, cameras, video players, and navigational systems. Today's mobile phones
          are commonly referred to as smartphones due to the additional voice and data services they offer.

          <strong className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">What To Check Before You Buy?</strong>
        </h2>
        <ol className=" pl-4 mb-4">
          <li className="text-base">
            <strong className="font-bold">1. Operating System & Processor:</strong> Android versions, Apple iOS or
            Qualcomm/ Mediatek chipsets determine overall performance, these operating systems vary in each mobile phone
            and serve different use cases. So choosing the right operating system for your smartphone is a crucial step.
          </li>
          <li className="text-base">
            <strong className="font-bold">2. Display Size & Type:</strong> Bigger AMOLED/LCD screens with higher
            resolution & aspect ratio offer better viewing experience, also the brightness of mobile phone displays can
            play a big factor for outdoor users.
          </li>
          <li className="text-base">
            <strong className="font-bold">3. RAM & Storage:</strong> Higher RAM (6GB-12GB) and internal storage
            (64GB-256GB) allows more apps, media files storage. Ideally a mobile phone with more than 4GB of ram is good
            for most of the users.
          </li>
          <li className="text-base">
            <strong className="font-bold">4. Rear & Selfie Cameras:</strong> More Megapixels (48MP-108MP), aperture
            size, optical zoom, image stabilization etc translate to detailed pictures and videos. But a mobile phone is
            not all about megapixels, the post processing plays a very important role too.
          </li>
          <li className="text-base">
            <strong className="font-bold">5. Battery & Fast Charging:</strong> Higher mAH battery capacity and support
            for fast charging like 65W chargers result in requiring lesser recharge cycles.
